<h3>🔥 Your Pitch</h3>
<p>In India, we observed that in last few years casualties due to Natural Calamities has increased in number and among all of them Lightning strike has emerged as the most fatal one. Hence, there is a serious requirement for a solution to this problem and after a no. of case studies we found a feasible solution for it.</p>
<p>This app aims to solve the real-life problem of the unprecedented deaths due to natural calamities, particularly Lightning. This solution has the capacity to outreach every individual in the country and save the lives of people from such tragedies using the prediction algorithm and with time accuracy it will get better and better. The ultimate goal of the solution is to predict lightning and alert the people at the same time.Here a single algorithm is actively monitoring all the pincodes of our country and calculating the occurrence probability of lightning strike in that area, and sending out alerts to the people via automated calls and sms in regional languages.</p>
